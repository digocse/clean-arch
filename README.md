Clean Architecture Sample

## About
This project is a sample of Clean Architecture applied to a Flutter app.
It extracts a map module from another private app and refactors it applying Clean Architecture concepts.

The idea is to display markers on the map for each gallery and a floating carousel containing all of them.
By tapping on a marker, the map will focus on it.
